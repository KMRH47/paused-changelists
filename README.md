# Paused Changelists

Temporarily shelve changelists while keeping them visible in your Changes panel.

## Installation

**From Marketplace:** Install from the [JetBrains Marketplace](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/28624-paused-changelists) or in IntelliJ IDEA: **Settings → Plugins → Marketplace → Search "Paused Changelists"**

**From Disk:** Download the latest release from [Releases](https://github.com/KMRH47/paused-changelists/releases) and install via **Settings → Plugins → ⚙️ → Install Plugin from Disk**

## How it works

Right-click any changelist and select **Toggle Pause Changelist** (or use `Ctrl+Alt+P`):
- **Pause**: Shelves changes and reverts them from your working directory. The changelist stays visible with a `[PAUSED]` prefix.
- **Unpause**: Restores changes back to the same changelist.

Perfect for when you need to temporarily set aside work without losing context.
